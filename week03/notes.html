                <h3>Arrays, Logic, & Loops</h3>
                <h4>Array literals</h4>
                <p>An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
                    of square brackets[]. Destructring of an array is the the concept of taking vales out a
                    of an array and placing them as individual values. Destructuring of arrays allows us to
                    assign multiple values at the same time. To retrieve a specific value in an aray, we write
                    its position in the [] sq bracket called the index.(pg. 90) To <b>add values</b> to an
                    array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation </b> is used to add new items
                    to a position w/in the index. Unused slots in the index have an <b>undefined</b> value.
                </p>

                <h4>Array methods</h4>
                <p>Using the <b>length</b> property allows you to manually make change. Unused slots in the index
                    have an <b>undefined</b> value.
                </p>

                <h4>Adding and removing values from arrays</h4>
                <p>To <b>add values</b> to an array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation
                    </b> is used to add new items to a position w/in the index. <br>To <b>remove</b> a value
                    from an array literal use the <b>delete</b> operator. Remove the last item from an array using
                    a <b>pop</b> method, while the <b>shift </b> method removes the first item. The <b>push</b>
                    method adds a new values to the end of the array. The <b>concat</b> will merge an array w/
                    other arrays. Some other methods are: <b>join, slicing, splicing, reverse, & sort,</b>
                    Find a if a values is in an array use the <b>indexOf</b> method. The include method will return
                    a boolean value if it has a particular element. It can be used to add an extra parameter to
                    indicate which index to start the search.Multidementional arrays which contains an array of an
                    array.
                </p>

                <h4>Sets</h4>
                <p><b>Sets</b> offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have
                    been duplicated. You create a set w/ the <b>new</b> operat and the <b>Set</b> constructor.
                    You can add values using the <b>add</b> method. To see the contents of a set enter the name of
                    the var that refers to it. The number of values in a set can be found using the <b>size()</b>
                    method.Other set methods are <b>has(),delete(), clear(), new Set(), Array.form()</b> A set can
                    be converted into an array by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an
                    array literal. Objs are store into set as long as the set exists, when the set is removed *+&
                    the set remains it can cause a memory leak, known as garbage-collected. It should be corrected
                    to prevent future problems.</p>

                <h4>Maps</h4>
                <p>Maps are a way of keeping a list of key & value pairs in other programming languages. (They are
                    similiar to hashes, hash tables, & dictionaries). Maps can use any data type as a key. Use
                    <b>size</b> propety to locate a number of key-value pairs. Create a map using the
                    <b>new</b> operator & a <b>Map</b> constructor, & a <b>set()</b> method to add to your maps.
                    Other methods used in maps are <b>get(), has(), delete(), clear(),</b> Maps can be converted
                    into nested arrays of key-value pairs using the spread operator and like weak sets, weak maps
                    can cause dead entries when the original obj is deleatd. Weak maps can use the <b>has(), get(),
                        set(), and delete()</b> methods.
                </p>

                <h4>if and else logic statements</h4>
                <p>Logic statement allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code.
                    The if runs a block of code <b>if</b> the confition in the () is true. The <b>else</b> statement
                    adds an alternative block of code to run the condition if it's false. A quick way of writing an
                    <b>if else </b> is to use the ternary operator <b>?</b> followed by at least 2 operands.
                </p>

                <h4>switch statements</h4>
                <p><b>Switch</b> statements consist of several <b>if</b> & <b>else</b> statemets making up a
                    logical decision tree. Use switch statement when there are several conditions to test. Use a
                    <b>case</b> keyword for ea. possible value and remember to end your statement w/ a
                    <b>break</b> to end the execution of the statement.
                </p>


                <h4>while loops</h4>
                <p>What ever type of loop you run it's important that a condition is met or else your code
                    will continue to run in a loop, this is known as an infinite loop. <b>While</b> loops runs a
                    block of code continuously until a condition becomes true.
                </p>

                <h4>do … while loops</h4>
                <p><b>do while</b> loops is similiar to a while loop. The differences is that the conditions comes
                    <i>after</i> the block code, regardless if the condition is true or not.
                </p>

                <h4> for loops</h4>
                <p>In <b>for</b> loops the initialization code is ran before the loop start. The condition
                    has to be satisfied for the loop to continue The after code is what to do after ea. iteration of
                    the loop, which is mostly used to increment a counter.
                </p>

                <h4>nested for loops</h4>
                <p>When a loop is placed inside of another loop this is a <b>nested loop</b>. It contains an inner
                    loop that runs all the way through before the nest step of the outer loop occurs.
                </p>

                <h4>Iterating over a collection</h4>
                <p>A for loop can be used to iterate over each value in an array. If we take our avengers
                    array example from earlier, we can create a for loop that outputs each item in the array. Maps
                    are also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a set. he loop
                    will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map. Maps are
                    also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a set. The loop
                    will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map.
                </p>
                <h3>Functions</h3>
                <h4>Function Declaration</h4>
                <p>To create a function we can use a <em>function declaration</em>.</p>
                <code>
                        function name(parameters) {<br>
                        &nbsp; ...body...<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                <p>The <em><strong>function </strong></em>keyword goes first, then goes <em><strong>the name of the
                            function</strong></em>, then a <em><strong>list of parameters</strong></em> between the
                    parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function,
                    also named &ldquo;the function body&rdquo;, between curly braces.
                </p>

                <h4>Local variables</h4>
                <p>A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.</p>

                <h4>Invoking a function</h4>
                <p>There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are
                    covered below. Define functions, using what is known as an arrow notation. To define a function
                    literal we can use a <b>function</b> declaration: like so <b>function()</b> keyword. You can
                    also define a function using an <b>expression</b> that assigns a function to a var
                </p>
                <code>
                        const goodbye = function(){<br>
                        console.log('Goodbye World!');<br>
                    </code>
                <p>
                    The 3rd way to define a function is w/ a constructor <b>Function()</b>, where it's entered as a
                    string like so:</p>
                <code>const hi new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');</code>

                <p>It's recommend not to use this way because of <b>various problems</b>. Next you need to
                    <b>invoke</b> a function inside of the funciton's body. This is done by entering
                    it's name followed by ():
                </p>
                <code>
                    hello();<br>
                    'Hello world!'<br>
                    </code>
                <p>FOOT NOTE:Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every
                    part of a program should only be written once. This voids duplication and means there’s no need
                    to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</p>

                <h4>Return values</h4>
                <p>All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes
                    after the <b>return</b> keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return anything (such as all
                    the examples we have seen so far) will return <b>undefined</b> by default.
                </p>

                <h4>Parameters and arguments</h4>
                <p><b>Parameters</b> and <b>arguments</b> are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent
                    values provided for the
                    function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are
                    set
                    when the function is defined.
                    When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments. you can use a single parameter or
                    several.
                    If the parameter is empty
                    it's <b>undefined</b> & an undefined parameter will return a <b>NaN</b>.When too many arguments
                    are
                    entered into a function we
                    can either use a <b>mean()</b> function to calculate numbers or use the var <b>arguments</b> for
                    multiple arguments. This acts
                    like an array. However for BEST PRACTICE it's better to use a <b>rest</b> operator. We can use a
                    rest parameter to improve our
                    <b>mean()</b> function so it accepts any number of values. <b>default perameters</b> in a
                    function
                    are values that will
                    be used by the function if no arguments are provided when it is invoked. To specify a default
                    parameter, simply assign
                    the default value to it in the function definition. <b>arrow =></b> syntax help make declaring
                    functions more succinct
                    using less verbose syntax. </p>
                <code>const square = x => x*x;<br>
                    </code>

                <h4>Hoisting―variables and functions</h4>
                <p>Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations
                    to the top of the current scope, regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined
                    using a function declaration are automatically hoisted, meaning they can be invoked before they have
                    been defined. Use a <b>hoist()</b> to invoke a function. This allows you to all <b>function
                        definitions</b> together at the end of the program. <b>variable hoisting</b> that use the var
                    keyword are automatically moved to the top of the current scope.
                    Variable assignment is not hoisted, made. When using var hoist, use <b>const</b> & <b>let</b> to
                    delcare variable at the beginning of a
                    block so hoisting is unnessary.
                </p>

                <h4>Callbacks―functions as a parameter</h4>
                <p>Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an
                    argument to another is known as a <b>callback</b>.Callback functions are made more flexible
                    using the callback parameter.
                </p>
                <code>
                        function
                        sing(song,callback) {<br>
                        console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.);<br>
                        callback();<br>
                    </code>
                <p>The actual callback is invoked in the body of the function where the () are used. You can sort
                    arrays w/ a <b>sort()</b> method using a callback. You can also do this with a <b>numericallys
                        function</b> and the sort() to sort numbers. An <b>array iterator</b> uses several ways to
                    use callbacks, making them more flexible. It also uses the arrow notation in many of the
                    callback methods. The <b>foreEach()</b> to loop through multiple values, the <b>map()</b> method
                    to iterate through an array, so forces the callback function as a parameter that invokes the
                    items in an array. Other methods used are: <b> Reduce() & filter()</b>. The <b>mean()</b>
                    function can be added to the reduce() method to add up all the values provided in an argument.
                </p>
                <p>A callback function is passed as an argument into another function. It contains a string of code.
                    You call the function by naming it, & it's followed by ( ), this tells the function to execute
                    the code in thee ( ). The argument consist of a method that has an event(onclick) & a function
                    of (whatToDo). The addEventListener method executes the function only when an event occurs.
                </p>

                <h3>Object Methods: this</h3>
                <p>
                    In JavaScript, some words that perform special function are reserved. One of those keyword is
                    <code>this</code>, which appears in many JavaScript frameworks such as Vue, jQuery, and others.
                    <code>this</code> value changes depending on where it is called. The six different ways for
                    assigning new values for <code>this</code> are:
                    <ol>
                        <li><code>this</code> in global context</li>
                        <li><code>this</code> in object construction</li>
                        <li><code>this</code> in object method</li>
                        <li><code>this</code> in simple function</li>
                        <li><code>this</code> in arrow function</li>
                        <li><code>this</code> in event listner</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs that are placed inside curly braces
                    <code>{}.</code> A JavaScript object is define with the following syntax:
                    <code>const myInfo = {name: 'Sunday', gender: 'Male', birthYear: '1981'}.</code> The properties
                    of an object can be accessed using either the dot notation or square bracket notation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Document Object Model (DOM) can be described as a representation of a HTML page as a tree of
                    nodes. TO access the value of elements on a HTML page, the following could be used:
                    <code>document.getElementById()</code>, <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code>,
                    <code>document.getElementsByTagNames()</code>, and <code>document.querySelector()</code>.
                </p>

                <h3>Objects</h3>
                <h4>Object literals</h4>
                <p>An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its
                    properties and methods in curly braces {} . Object literals are a distinguishing feature of the
                    JavaScript language, as they allow objects to be created quickly without the need for defining a
                    class. They also provide a useful way of organizing your code without polluting the global
                    namespace.
                </p>
                <code>"const superman = {<br>
                        name: 'Superman',<br>

                <h4>Adding properties to objects</h4>
                <p>New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program. This is done by
                    simply assigning a value to the new property. For example, if we wanted to add a new city
                    property to our superman object, we would do it like so:
                </p>
                <code>superman.city = 'Metropolis';<br>
                        << 'Metropolis' <br>Changing properties<br>superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';<br>
                            << 'Kal-El' <br>to delete<br>delete superman.fly<br>Nesting Objects<br>const jla = {
                                superman: { realName: 'Clark Kent' },<br>
                                batman: { realName: 'Bruce Wayne' },<br>
                                wonderWoman: { realName: 'Diana Prince" },<br>
                                flash: { realName: 'Barry Allen' },<br>
                                aquaman: { realName: 'Arthur Curry' },<br>
                                }
                            </code>

                <h4>Object methods</h4>>
                <p> An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function. This is useful
                    when there are a large number of parameters, as it allows the arguments to be
                    provided by name and in any order. This means you don't have to remember the
                    order to enter them when invoking a function. Using a function called greet() . This accepts
                    three parameters:
                </p>
                <code>
                    function greet({greeting,name,age}) {<br>
                    return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;<br>
                    }</code>
                <p>To demonstrate using <em>this</em> , we'll create a dice object that has a sides property
                    and a roll() method that returns a number between 1 and the number of sides.
                    Here’s the code to create our dice object:
                </p>
                <code>
                    const dice = {<br>
                    sides: 6,<br>
                    roll() {
                    return Math.floor(this.sides * Math.random()) + 1;<br>
                    }<br>
                    }
                </code>

                <h3>JSON</h3>
                <p>JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, was invented by Douglas Crockford in 2001. It is an
                    extremely popular lightweight data-storage format that is used by a large number of services for
                    data serialization and configuration. It is often used to exchange information between web
                    services, and is employed by sites such as Twitter, Facebook and Trello to share information.
                    The beauty of JSON is that it manages to hit the sweet spot between being both human- and
                    machine-readable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation that we have just seen. There
                    are, however, a couple of key differences:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Property names must be double-quoted</li>
                    <li>Permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and
                        objects</li>
                    <li>Functions are not permitted values</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object:<br>
                </p>
                <code>
                JSON.parse(batman);<br>
                << { name: 'Batman' ,<br>
                    'real name': 'Bruce Wayne',<br>
                    height: 74,<br>
                    weight: 210,<br>
                    hero: true,<br>
                    villain: false,<br>
                    allies: [ 'Robin', 'Batgirl', 'Superman' ] }
                </code>
                <p>The stringify() method does the opposite, taking a JavaScript object and returning a string of JSON
                    data
                </p>

                <h3>Document Object Model</h3>
                <p>
                    There are some methods from DOM Level 0 that can still be employed to access commonly used
                    elements. These include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Document.body returns the body element of a web page.</li>
                    <li> Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.
                    </li>
                    <li> Document.links returns a node list of all the &lt a &gt elements and &lt area &gt
                        elements that have an href attribute.</li>
                    <li> Document.anchors returns a node list of all the &lt a &gt elements that have a name
                        attribute.</li>
                    <li> Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>getElementsBy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>getElementById()</code> method does exactly what it says on the tin. It returns a
                        reference to the element with a unique id attribute that is given as an argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>getElementsByTagName()</code> will return a live node list of all the elements with
                        the tag name that is provided as an argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> will return a live node list of all elements that have
                        the class name that is supplied as an argument.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Query Selectors </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>document.querySelector()</code> method allows you to use CSS notation to find the
                        first element in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector provided as an
                        argument.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> method also uses CSS notation but returns a node
                        list of all the elements in the document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements
                        match, it will return an empty node list.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Getting and Setting Attributes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>getAttribute()</code> method returns the value of the attribute provided as an
                        argument</li>
                    <li><code>setAttribute()</code> can change the value of an element’s attributes. It takes two
                        arguments</li>
                </ul>
