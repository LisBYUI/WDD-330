                <h3>Arrays, Logic, & Loops</h3>
                <h4>Array literals</h4>
                <p>An array is an ordered list of values. To create an array literal, simply write a pair
                    of square brackets[]. Destructring of an array is the the concept of taking vales out a
                    of an array and placing them as individual values. Destructuring of arrays allows us to
                    assign multiple values at the same time. To retrieve a specific value in an aray, we write
                    its position in the [] sq bracket called the index.(pg. 90) To <b>add values</b> to an
                    array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation </b> is used to add new items
                    to a position w/in the index. Unused slots in the index have an <b>undefined</b> value.
                </p>

                <h4>Array methods</h4>
                <p>Using the <b>length</b> property allows you to manually make change. Unused slots in the index
                    have an <b>undefined</b> value.
                </p>

                <h4>Adding and removing values from arrays</h3>
                    <p>To <b>add values</b> to an array, place the string in the element. The index <b>notation
                        </b> is used to add new items to a position w/in the index. <br>To <b>remove</b> a value
                        from an array literal use the <b>delete</b> operator. Remove the last item from an array using
                        a <b>pop</b> method, while the <b>shift </b> method removes the first item. The <b>push</b>
                        method adds a new values to the end of the array. The <b>concat</b> will merge an array w/
                        other arrays. Some other methods are: <b>join, slicing, splicing, reverse, & sort,</b>
                        Find a if a values is in an array use the <b>indexOf</b> method. The include method will return
                        a boolean value if it has a particular element. It can be used to add an extra parameter to
                        indicate which index to start the search.Multidementional arrays which contains an array of an
                        array.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Sets</h4>
                    <p><b>Sets</b> offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have
                        been duplicated. You create a set w/ the <b>new</b> operat and the <b>Set</b> constructor.
                        You can add values using the <b>add</b> method. To see the contents of a set enter the name of
                        the var that refers to it. The number of values in a set can be found using the <b>size()</b>
                        method.Other set methods are <b>has(),delete(), clear(), new Set(), Array.form()</b> A set can
                        be converted into an array by placing the set, along with the spread operator directly inside an
                        array literal. Objs are store into set as long as the set exists, when the set is removed *+&
                        the set remains it can cause a memory leak, known as garbage-collected. It should be corrected
                        to prevent future problems.</p>

                    <h4>Maps</h4>
                    <p>Maps are a way of keeping a list of key & value pairs in other programming languages. (They are
                        similiar to hashes, hash tables, & dictionaries). Maps can use any data type as a key. Use
                        <b>size</b> propety to locate a number of key-value pairs. Create a map using the
                        <b>new</b> operator & a <b>Map</b> constructor, & a <b>set()</b> method to add to your maps.
                        Other methods used in maps are <b>get(), has(), delete(), clear(),</b> Maps can be converted
                        into nested arrays of key-value pairs using the spread operator and like weak sets, weak maps
                        can cause dead entries when the original obj is deleatd. Weak maps can use the <b>has(), get(),
                            set(), and delete()</b> methods.
                    </p>

                    <h4>if and else logic statements</h4>
                    <p>Logic statement allow you to control the flow of a program by running different blocks of code.
                        The if runs a block of code <b>if</b> the confition in the () is true. The <b>else</b> statement
                        adds an alternative block of code to run the condition if it's false. A quick way of writing an
                        <b>if else </b> is to use the ternary operator <b>?</b> followed by at least 2 operands.
                    </p>

                    <h4>switch statements</h4>
                    <p><b>Switch</b> statements consist of several <b>if</b> & <b>else</b> statemets making up a
                        logical decision tree. Use switch statement when there are several conditions to test. Use a
                        <b>case</b> keyword for ea. possible value and remember to end your statement w/ a
                        <b>break</b> to end the execution of the statement.
                    </p>


                    <h4>while loops</h4>
                    <p>What ever type of loop you run it's important that a condition is met or else your code
                        will continue to run in a loop, this is known as an infinite loop. <b>While</b> loops runs a
                        block of code continuously until a condition becomes true.
                    </p>

                    <h4>do … while loops</h4>
                    <p><b>do while</b> loops is similiar to a while loop. The differences is that the conditions comes
                        <i>after</i> the block code, regardless if the condition is true or not.
                    </p>

                    <h4> for loops</h4>
                    <p>In <b>for</b> loops the initialization code is ran before the loop start. The condition
                        has to be satisfied for the loop to continue The after code is what to do after ea. iteration of
                        the loop, which is mostly used to increment a counter.
                    </p>

                    <h4>nested for loops</h4>
                    <p>When a loop is placed inside of another loop this is a <b>nested loop</b>. It contains an inner
                        loop that runs all the way through before the nest step of the outer loop occurs.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Iterating over a collection</h4>
                    <p>A for loop can be used to iterate over each value in an array. If we take our avengers
                        array example from earlier, we can create a for loop that outputs each item in the array. Maps
                        are also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a set. he loop
                        will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map. Maps are
                        also enumerable, so it's also possible to loop over a map in a similar way to a set. The loop
                        will iterate over each key-value pair in the same order as they were added to the map.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Functions</h3>
                    <h4>Function Declaration</h4>
                    <p>To create a function we can use a <em>function declaration</em>.</p>
                    <code>
                        function name(parameters) {<br>
                        &nbsp; ...body...<br>
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p>The <em><strong>function </strong></em>keyword goes first, then goes <em><strong>the name of the
                                function</strong></em>, then a <em><strong>list of parameters</strong></em> between the
                        parentheses (comma-separated, empty in the example above) and finally the code of the function,
                        also named &ldquo;the function body&rdquo;, between curly braces.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Local variables</h4>
                    <p>A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.</p>

                    <h4>Invoking a function</h4>
                    <p>There are a number of ways to define a function in JavaScript. Three of the most common are
                        covered below. Define functions, using what is known as an arrow notation. To define a function
                        literal we can use a <b>function</b> declaration: like so <b>function()</b> keyword. You can
                        also define a function using an <b>expression</b> that assigns a function to a var
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        const goodbye = function(){<br>
                        console.log('Goodbye World!');<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>
                        The 3rd way to define a function is w/ a constructor <b>Function()</b>, where it's entered as a
                        string like so:</p>
                    <code>const hi new Function('console.log("Hi World!");');</code>

                    <p>It's recommend not to use this way because of <b>various problems</b>. Next you need to
                        <b>invoke</b> a function inside of the funciton's body. This is done by entering
                        it's name followed by ():
                    </p>
                    <code>
                    hello();<br>
                    'Hello world!'<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>FOOT NOTE:Don’t Repeat Yourself,or DRY, is a principle of programming that specifies that every
                        part of a program should only be written once. This voids duplication and means there’s no need
                        to keep multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</p>

                    <h4>Return values</h4>
                    <p>All functions return a value, which can be specified using the return statement, which comes
                        after the <b>return</b> keyword. A function that doesn’t explicitly return anything (such as all
                        the examples we have seen so far) will return <b>undefined</b> by default.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Parameters and arguments</h4>
                    <p><b>Parameters</b> and <b>arguments</b> are terms that are often used interchangeably to represent
                        values provided for the
                        function as an input. There is a subtle difference though: any parameters a function needs are
                        set
                        when the function is defined.
                        When a function isinvoked, it is provided with arguments. you can use a single parameter or
                        several.
                        If the parameter is empty
                        it's <b>undefined</b> & an undefined parameter will return a <b>NaN</b>.When too many arguments
                        are
                        entered into a function we
                        can either use a <b>mean()</b> function to calculate numbers or use the var <b>arguments</b> for
                        multiple arguments. This acts
                        like an array. However for BEST PRACTICE it's better to use a <b>rest</b> operator. We can use a
                        rest parameter to improve our
                        <b>mean()</b> function so it accepts any number of values. <b>default perameters</b> in a
                        function
                        are values that will
                        be used by the function if no arguments are provided when it is invoked. To specify a default
                        parameter, simply assign
                        the default value to it in the function definition. <b>arrow =></b> syntax help make declaring
                        functions more succinct
                        using less verbose syntax. </p>
                    <code>const square = x => x*x;<br>
                    </code>

                    <h4>Hoisting―variables and functions</h4>
                    <p>Hoisting is the JavaScript interpreter’s action of moving all variable and function declarations
                        to
                        the top of the current scope,
                        regardless of where they are defined. Functions that are defined using a function declaration
                        are
                        automatically hoisted, meaning
                        they can be invoked before they have been defined. Use a <b>hoist()</b> to invoke a function.
                        This
                        allows you to all <b>function
                            definitions</b> together at the end of the program. <b>variable hoisting</b> that use the
                        var
                        keyword are automatically moved to
                        the top of the current scope. Variable assignment is not hoisted, however. This means that a
                        variable assigned at the end of a
                        function will have a value of undefined until the assignment is made. When using var hoist, use
                        <b>const</b> & <b>let</b> to
                        delcare variable at the beginning of a block so hoisting is unnessary.</p>

                    <h4>Callbacks―functions as a parameter</h4>
                    <p>Functions can also be given as a parameter to another function. A function that is passed as an
                        argument to another is known as a <b>callback</b>.Callback functions are made more flexible
                        using the callback parameter.
                    </p>
                    <code>
                        function
                        sing(song,callback) {<br>
                        console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}.);<br>
                        callback();<br>
                    </code>
                    <p>The actual callback is invoked in the body of the function where the () are used. You can sort
                        arrays w/ a <b>sort()</b> method using a callback. You can also do this with a <b>numericallys
                            function</b> and the sort() to sort numbers. An <b>array iterator</b> uses several ways to
                        use callbacks, making them more flexible. It also uses the arrow notation in many of the
                        callback methods. The <b>foreEach()</b> to loop through multiple values, the <b>map()</b> method
                        to iterate through an array, so forces the callback function as a parameter that invokes the
                        items in an array. Other methods used are: <b> Reduce() & filter()</b>. The <b>mean()</b>
                        function can be added to the reduce() method to add up all the values provided in an argument.
                    </p>
                    <p>A callback function is passed as an argument into another function. It contains a string of code.
                        You call the function by naming it, & it's followed by ( ), this tells the function to execute
                        the code in thee ( ). The argument consist of a method that has an event(onclick) & a function
                        of (whatToDo). The addEventListener method executes the function only when an event occurs.
