                <h3>How Forms Work </h3>
                <p>There are two parts to a working form. The first part is the form that you see on the page itself
                    that is created using HTML markup. Forms are made up of buttons, input fields, and drop-down menus
                    (collectively known as form controls) used to collect information from the user. Forms may also
                    contain text and other elements.
                </p>
                <p>The other component of a web form is an application or script on
                    the server that processes the information collected by the form and returns an appropriate response.
                </p>
                <h3>The form Element</h3>
                <p>Forms are added to web pages using the form element. The form element is a
                    container for all the content of the form, including some number of form controls, such as text
                    entry fields and buttons. It may also contain block elements (h1, p, and lists, for example).
                    However, it may not contain another form element.
                </p>

                    </code>
                <p>In addition to being a container for form control elements, the form element has some attributes that
                    are necessary for interacting with the form-processing program on the server.
                </p>
                <h4>The action attribute</h4>
                <p> The action attribute provides the location (URL) of the application or script (sometimes called the
                    action page) that will be used to process the form.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web forms may be processed using one of the following technologies:

                </table>
                <h4>The method attribute</h4>
                <p>The method attribute specifies how the information should be sent to the server. There are only two
                    methods for sending this encoded data to the server: POST or GET, indicated using the method
                    attribute in the form element. The method is optional and will default to GET if omitted.
                </p>
                <h5>The POST method</h5>
                <p>When the formâ€™s method is set to POST, the browser sends a separate server request containing some
                    special headers followed by the data. Only the server sees the content of this request, thus it is
                    the best method for sending secure information such as credit card or other personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The POST method is also preferable for sending a lot of data, such as a lengthy text entry, because
                    there is no character limit as there is for GET.
                </p>
                <h5>The GET method</h5>
                <p>
                    With the GET method, the encoded form data gets tacked right onto the URL sent to the server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The GET method is appropriate if you want users to be able to bookmark the results of a form
                    submission (such as a list of search results). Because the content of the form is in plain sight,
                    GET is not appropriate for forms with private personal or financial information. In addition, GET
                    may not be used when the form is used to upload a file.
                </p>
                <h4>Accessing Form Elements</h4>
                <p>
                    The legacy DOM had a useful property called document.forms that returns an HTML collection of all
                    the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. Even though there is only one
                    form, a collection will still be returned, so we have to use index notation to return the first (and
                    only) form object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                    const form = document.forms[0];
                </code>
                </p>

                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming is often used to model representations of objects in the real world.
                    There are three main concepts in OOP: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.
                </p>
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is an approach of sharing common functionality within a collection of classes. It
                    provides an ability to avoid code duplication in a class that needs the same data and functions
                    which another class already has. At the same time, it allows us to override or extend functionality
                    that should have a different behavior.
                </p>

                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>
                    Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming is an ability to create a property, a function, or an
                    object that has more than one realization.
                    Polymorphism is an ability to substitute classes that have common functionality in sense of methods
                    and data. In other words, it is an ability of multiple object types to implement the same
                    functionality that can work in a different way but supports a common interface.
                </p>
                <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                <p>
                    Inheritance is a very useful way to reduce the amount of code that you need to write, as well as a
                    way to extend the functionality of your fancy Classes without having to re-write everything. Using
                    inheritance will make your code more efficient and meaningful.
