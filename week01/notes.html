                    <h3>Introduction of JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript is a structured interpreted programming language, high-level scripting with weak
                        dynamic
                        typing and multiparadigm. Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main
                        technologies
                        on the World Wide Web.</p>
                    <p>Along with HTML and CSS, JavaScript forms the basis of front-end web development, allowing the
                        creating of interactive elements.</p>
                    <p>JavaScript can be divided into three parts: the core, client side, and server side.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <strong>core&nbsp;</strong>is the heart of the language, including its operators,
                            expressions, statementes, and subprograms.</li>
                        <li><strong>Client-side</strong> JavaScript is a collection of objects that support the control
                            of a
                            browser and interactions with uses. <strong>Client-side</strong> JavaScript is an
                            HTML-embedded
                            scripting language. We refer to every collection of JavaScript code as a <em>script</em>. An
                            HTML document can include any number of embedded scripts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Server-side</strong> JavaScript is a collection of the objects that make the
                            language
                            useful on a Web server.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Uses of JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>The originals goal of the JavaScript was to provide programming at both the server and the client
                        ends of a Webconnections.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language and needs a host environment to run. Because of its
                        origins, the main environment that JavaScript runs in is the browser, although it can be run in
                        other environments. </p>
                    <p>Interactions with user through form elements, such as buttons and menus, can be conveniently
                        described in JavaScript.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Another interesting capability of JavaScript was made possible by the development to the Document
                        Object Model (DOM), wich allows JavaScript scripts to access and modify the style properties and
                        content of the elements of a displayed HTML document, making formally static documents highly
                        dynamic.&nbsp;</p>
