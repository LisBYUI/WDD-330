                <h3>Further Functions</h3>
                <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
                <p>Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript meaning they can be passed around in the same way as
                    every other value. They can have their own methods and properties, they can accept methods as
                    parameters and they can be returned by other functions</p>
                <h4>Function Properties and Methods</h4>
                <code>
                        function square(x) {<br/>
                        return x * x;<br/>
                        }   <br/>           
                            <br/>
                        square.length; <br>            
                        >> 1 - accepts one parameter
                    </code>
                <h4>Call and Apply Methods</h4>
                <p>The call() methods can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is
                    provided by the first argument.</p>
                <code>
                            function sayHello() {<br/>
                            return `Hello, my name is ${this.name}`;<br/>
                            } <br/>       
                            <br/>
                            const kent = {name: 'Clark'};<br/>
                            sayHello.call(kent);<br/>
                            >> 'Hello, my name is Kent';<br/>
                        </code>
                <p>The apply() method works in the same way, except the arguments of the function are provided as an
                    array, even when there is only one argument.</p>
                <code>
                            square.call(null, 4);<br/>
                            square.apply(null, [4]);<br/>
                    </code>
                <h4>Memoization</h4>
                <code>
                        function square(x) {<br/>
                        square.cache = squre.cache || {};<br/>
                        if (!sqaure.cache[x]) { // checks whether the argument is already stored in the cache<br/>
                        square.cache[x] = x*x; // saves result in the cache<br/>
                        }<br/>
                        <br/>
                        return square.cache[x];<br/>
                        }<br/>
                        <br/>
                        square(3);<br/>
                        >> 9<br/>
                        square(-11);<br/>
                        >> 121<br/>
                        square.cache;<br/>
                        >> {'3': 9, '-11': 121}<br/>
                    </code>

                <h4>Temporary Variables</h4>
                <p>There is no way to remove a variable from a scope once it's declared. To make a variable
                    temporary place it inside an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)</p>
                <code>
                        let a = 1;<br/>
                        letb = 2;<br/>
                        (() => {<br/>
                        const temp = a;<br/>
                        a = b;<br/>
                        b = temp;<br/>
                        })();<br/>
                        <br/>
                        a;<br/>
                        >> 2<br/>
                        b;<br/>
                        >> 1<br/>
                        temp;<br/>
                        >> Error: "temp is not defined"<br/>
                    </code>

                <h4>Functions that Define and Rewrite Themselves</h4>
                <p>JavaScript allows its method to redifine itself by assigning an anonymouse function to a variable
                    that has the same name as the function</p>
                <code>
                function party() {<br/>
                console.log('Hello');<br/>
                party = function() { // anonymous function<br/>
                console.log('world!');<br/>
                }<br/>
                }<br/>
                First call<br/>
                party();<br/>
                >> 'Hello'<br/>
                Succeeding calls will display the anonymous function<br/>
                party();<br/>
                >> 'world'!<br/>
                party();<br/>
                >> 'world'!<br/>
            </code>

                <h4>Recursive Functions</h4>
                <p>Functions that invokes itself until certain condition is met. It's a useful tool to use when an
                    iterative process is involved.</p>
                <code>
                    function factorial(n) {<br/>
                    if (n === 0) {<br/>
                    return 1;<br/>
                    } else {<br/>
                    retrn n * factorial(n - 1);<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    }         <br/>         
                </code>

                <h4>Promises</h4>
                <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Resolved - the asynchronous operation was completed successfully</li>
                    <li>Rejected - the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn’t
                        successfully completed or resulted in an error.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both of these outcomes will return any relevant data, and you can take the appropriate action
                    based on the
                    outcome of the promise</p>

                <code>
                    const promise = new Promise( (reject, resolve) => {<br/>
                    // initialization code goes header<br/>
                    if (success) {<br/>
                    resolve(value);<br/>
                    } else {<br/>
                    reject(error);<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    })           <br/>         
              </code>
                <h4>Functions That Returns Functions</h4>
                <code>
                    function returnHello() {<br/>
                    console.log('returnHello() called');<br/>
                    return function() {<br/>
                    console.log('Hello world');<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    Assign function to a variable to invoke the returned function<br/>
                    const hello = returnHello();<br/>
                    hello();<br/>
                    >> 'Hello world'      <br/>            
            </code>
                <h4>Closures</h4>
                <p>
                    A closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. Closures are
                    created every time a function is created, at function creation time
                </p>
                <code>
function makeAdder(x) {<br/>
return function(y) {<br/>
return x + y;<br/>
}<br/>
}<br/>
var add1 = makeAdder(1);<br/>
var add2 = makeAdder(2);<br/>
console.log(add1(1)); // 2<br/>
console.log(add2(2)); // 4   <br/>                 
              </code>

                <h4>Currying</h4>
                <p>A function is said to be curried when not all arguments have been supplied to the function, so it
                    returns another function that retains the arguments already provided, and expets the remaining
                    arguments
                    that were omitted when the original function was called. A final result is only returned once all
                    the
                    expected arguments have eventually been provided.
                </p>
                <code>
                    function multiplier(x,y) {<br/>
                    if (y === undefined) {<br/>
                    return function(z) {<br/>
                    return x * z;<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    } else {<br/>
                    return x * y;<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    }     <br/>               
              </code>

                <h3>AJAX</h3>
                <p>
                    Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and
                    it
                    dynamically updates web pages without reloading. This enables data to be sent and received
                    in the
                    background, as well as portions of a page to be updated in response to user events, while
                    the rest
                    of the program continues to run.
                </p>
                <h4>Clients and Servers</h4>
                <h5>Client</h5>
                <p>
                    A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server,
                    which
                    processes the request and sends back a response to the client.
                </p>
                <h5>Server</h5>
                <p>
                    Ajax was a neat acronym that referred to the different parts of the process being used:
                </p>
                <table>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Asynchronous</td>
                            <td>When a request for data is sent, the program doesn&rsquo;t have to stop and wait
                                for the
                                response. It can carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response
                                is
                                received. By using callbacks to manage this, programs are able to run in an
                                efficient
                                way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.</span><br></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>JavaScript</td>
                            <td>JavaScript was always considered a front-end language, not used to communicate
                                with the
                                server. Ajax enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a
                                server,
                                allowing content to be updated in real time.&nbsp;</span><br></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>XML</span><br></td>
                            <td>When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to
                                return data.
                                Many different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in
                                Ajax
                                nowadays is JSON, which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML.
                                (Although it
                                has never really taken off, the termAjaj is sometimes used to describe the
                                technique.)
                                JSON also has the advantage of being natively supported in JavaScript, so you
                                can deal
                                with JavaScript objects rather than having to parse XML files using DOM
                                methods.<br>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table>
